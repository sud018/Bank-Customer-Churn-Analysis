# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis

## Background and overview
This project focuses on analyzing **Customer Churn Patterns** in the banking sector using a real-world-like dataset. This dataset is taken from Kaggle and contains banking customer information with attributes like:
- **Customer demographics** (age, gender, geography)
- **Account activity** (tenure, balance, number of products, activity status)
- **Churn status** (whether the customer exited the bank or stayed)

The Objective of this analysis is to:
- Explore **key drivers of customer churn** in the banking sector
- Visualize **churn trends** across customer profiles and behaviours
- Calculate **churn rates** using various factors like Age, Activity, Tenure, IsActive
- Suggest **strategies** to improve customer retention and engagement

An interactive Tableau Dashboard is created to facilitate stakeholders with clear, visual insights and allow interactive exploration.

## Executive Summary
This analysis revealed a significant **churn issue**, with approximately 20% of customers leaving the bank. The main factors affecting are Age, Geography, and IsActiveMember. According to the observation, the age group above 40 years is leaving the bank where the churn is especially elevated, and the problem is **regionally concentrated**, with a huge loss of customers in Germany. Another factor affecting is InactiveMembers, with inactivity nearly doubling the likelihood of churn. 

Other patterns include:
- Tenure shows no strong correlation with churn, indicating that even long-term customers are at risk of leaving.
- Female customers churn at a slightly higher rate than males.
